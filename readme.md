## Setting up React for ES6 w/ Webpack and Babel

- Run `npm install` or `npm start` to download React, ReactDOM, Babel & Webpack (see /package.json)

- You may have to install Webpack dev server to get going. Run `npm install webpack-dev-server -g`

- Run `webpack-dev-server --progress --inline` to launch a dev server that will be used to run the app or you can run `npm start` instead

- Once the server is running go to this url to see the components: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

- To run a build go to the command line and run `webpack`
