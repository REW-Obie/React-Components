## Setting up React for ES6 w/ Webpack and Babel

- Run `npm install` to download dependencies (see /package.json)

- You may have to install Webpack dev server to get going. Run `npm install webpack-dev-server -g`

- Run `npm start` to launch a dev server

- Once the server is running go to this url to see the components: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

- To run a manual build run `webpack`
